# 🚀 Auto-Tracking Setup Guide

## 📊 What Was Created

Your LeetCode journey now has **fully automated tracking**! Here's what's been set up:

### 🔧 Files Created:
- **.github/workflows/update-stats.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow
- **scripts/progress-tracker.js** - Problem counter script  
- **package.json** - Node.js configuration
- **stats.json** - Live statistics file
- **update-progress.sh** - Manual update script
- **tracking-setup.md** - This documentation

### 📈 Live Features Added:
- **Real-time badges** showing problems solved, current day, success rate
- **GitHub streak calendar** automatically tracking your commits
- **Activity graph** showing your coding pattern
- **Dynamic progress bars** that update with each commit
- **Automated daily stats updates** via GitHub Actions

## 🎯 How It Works

### Automatic Tracking:
1. **Every time you commit** → GitHub Actions triggers
2. **Script counts** your `.java` files in `Daily-contest/` folders
3. **Stats.json updates** with new numbers
4. **Badges refresh** automatically in your README

### Manual Updates:
```bash
# Run anytime to update stats manually
./update-progress.sh

# Or run the Node.js script directly
node scripts/progress-tracker.js --save
```

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

✅ **Problems Solved:** Counts all `.java` files  
✅ **Days Active:** Counts folders in `Daily-contest/`  
✅ **Success Rate:** Problems solved vs days elapsed  
✅ **Current Day:** Days since Oct 1, 2025  
✅ **Streak:** Via GitHub commit history  
✅ **Progress:** Visual bars and percentages  

## 🔥 Your Daily Workflow

1. **Solve a LeetCode problem**
2. **Create folder:** `Daily-contest/oct-X-25/`
3. **Add files:** `XXXX.java` and `XXXX-problem-summary.md`
4. **Commit & push** to GitHub
5. **Everything updates automatically!** ✨

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If badges don't show:**
- Make sure `stats.json` exists in your repo
- Check that GitHub Actions workflow ran successfully
- Verify the repository is public

**If counting is wrong:**
- Ensure `.java` files are in `Daily-contest/` subfolders
- Run `./update-progress.sh` manually to debug

**GitHub Actions not running:**
- Check `.github/workflows/update-stats.yml` exists
- Verify you have commit permissions
- GitHub Actions must be enabled in repository settings
