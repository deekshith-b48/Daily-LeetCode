# 🔦 Comprehensive Solution Report: Number of Laser Beams in a Bank

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

**Inputs**:  
- `bank`: 2D matrix represented as array of strings, where each string is a row
- `'0'` = empty cell, `'1'` = security device

**Laser Beam Conditions**:  
A laser beam exists between two devices if:
1. Devices are on different rows: `r1 < r2`
2. No devices exist in any row between `r1` and `r2`

**Goal**:  
Return the **total number of laser beams** in the bank

**Output**:  
- Single integer representing total laser beams

## 🔍 Key Observations and Constraints

### 🎯 Critical Insights:
1. **Row-based grouping**: Devices in the same row don't form beams with each other
2. **Consecutive non-empty rows**: Beams only form between consecutive non-empty rows (no devices in between)
3. **Multiplicative counting**: If row `r1` has `a` devices and row `r2` has `b` devices, they contribute `a × b` beams
4. **Zero-row handling**: Rows with no devices are skipped in the beam calculation

### ⚠️ Constraints Analysis:
- **Small grid size**: Maximum 500×500 cells
- **Simple counting**: Each row can be processed independently to count devices
- **Edge cases**:
  - All rows empty → 0 beams
  - Only one row with devices → 0 beams
  - Consecutive rows with devices → beams = product of device counts

## 📚 Relevant Concepts and Theory

### 🔍 Row Processing Strategy
The key insight is that we only care about **consecutive non-empty rows**. We can:
1. **Count devices per row** by scanning each row
2. **Track previous non-empty row's device count**
3. **Multiply current row's device count with previous non-empty row's count**
4. **Update previous count** for next iteration

### 📊 Multiplicative Counting
For two consecutive non-empty rows with `a` and `b` devices respectively, the number of beams is `a × b` because:
- Each device in the first row forms a beam with each device in the second row
- This is a complete bipartite graph between the two sets of devices

### 🎯 Key Insight: Skip Empty Rows
We process rows sequentially and only consider rows with at least one device. When we encounter a non-empty row, we multiply its device count with the previous non-empty row's count.

---

## 🧠 Logical Analysis

### ✅ Why This Approach Works:
- **Complete coverage**: Every valid beam pair is counted exactly once
- **Efficient processing**: O(m × n) time complexity with single pass through the grid
- **No complex data structures**: Simple variable tracking suffices

### 🎯 Key Insight: Consecutive Non-empty Rows
The condition "no devices in between" means we only connect **consecutive non-empty rows**. If there are empty rows between two non-empty rows, they break the beam connection.

This transforms the problem into:  
**Sum of products of device counts for all pairs of consecutive non-empty rows**

---

## 🎯 Effective Strategy

### 📝 Plan:
1. **Initialize** `prevDevices = 0` (count of devices in previous non-empty row)
2. **For each row** in the bank:
   - Count number of devices in current row
   - If current row has devices:
     - Add `prevDevices × currentDevices` to total beams
     - Set `prevDevices = currentDevices`
   - If current row is empty, skip (don't update prevDevices)
3. **Return** total beams

### 🛠️ Design Decisions:
- **Single pass**: Process each row once
- **Variable tracking**: Use `prevDevices` to remember last non-empty row's device count
- **Simple multiplication**: For each pair of consecutive non-empty rows, add their product

## 🧪 Illustrative Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**: `bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]`

### Step-by-step processing:

**Row 0**: `"011001"` → devices = 3
- `prevDevices = 0`, so no beams added
- `prevDevices = 3`

**Row 1**: `"000000"` → devices = 0
- Skip (empty row)

**Row 2**: `"010100"` → devices = 2
- `beams += 3 × 2 = 6`
- `prevDevices = 2`

**Row 3**: `"001000"` → devices = 1
- `beams += 2 × 1 = 2`
- `prevDevices = 1`

**Total beams = 6 + 2 = 8** ✅

**Example 2**: `bank = ["000","111","000"]`

### Step-by-step processing:

**Row 0**: `"000"` → devices = 0
- Skip

**Row 1**: `"111"` → devices = 3
- `prevDevices = 0`, so no beams added
- `prevDevices = 3`

**Row 2**: `"000"` → devices = 0
- Skip

**Total beams = 0** ✅

## ⚡ Optimal Approach

**Single Pass with Variable Tracking** is optimal because:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m × n) - scan each cell exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - only constant extra space
- **Handles all cases correctly**: Including edge cases and maximum constraints
- **Simple implementation**: Easy to understand and debug

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Initialize** `prevDevices = 0` and `totalBeams = 0`
2. **For each row** in `bank`:
   - Count devices in current row
   - If `currentDevices > 0`:
     - Add `prevDevices × currentDevices` to `totalBeams`
     - Set `prevDevices = currentDevices`
   - If `currentDevices == 0`, do nothing (skip empty row)
3. **Return** `totalBeams`

---

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

### ⏱️ Time Complexity: **O(m × n)**
- **Scan each row**: O(n) per row
- **m rows**: O(m × n) total
- **Total**: O(m × n) where m = number of rows, n = number of columns

### 💾 Space Complexity: **O(1)**
- **Constant space**: Only a few integer variables
- **No additional data structures**: Input is read-only

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

### ✅ Basic Cases
1. **Example 1**: `["011001","000000","010100","001000"]` → `8`
2. **Example 2**: `["000","111","000"]` → `0`

### ⚠️ Edge Cases
3. **All empty rows**: `["000","000"]` → `0`
4. **Only one row with devices**: `["111"]` → `0`
5. **Two consecutive rows with devices**: `["11","11"]` → `4` (each of 2 devices in first row connects to each of 2 in second)

### 🚀 Boundary Cases
6. **Maximum grid**: 500×500 with all devices → large number but within int range
7. **Minimum grid**: 1×1 with device → `0` (only one row)
