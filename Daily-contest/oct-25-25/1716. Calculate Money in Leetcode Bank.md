# 💰 Comprehensive Solution Report: Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

**Inputs**:  
- `n`: Number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)

**Saving Pattern**:  
- **Week 1**: Monday=$1, Tuesday=$2, ..., Sunday=$7
- **Week 2**: Monday=$2, Tuesday=$3, ..., Sunday=$8  
- **Week k**: Monday=$k, Tuesday=$(k+1), ..., Sunday=$(k+6)

**Goal**:  
Return the **total amount of money** saved after `n` days

**Output**:  
- Single integer representing total savings

## 🔍 Key Observations and Constraints

### 🎯 Critical Insights:
1. **Weekly pattern**: Each week follows an arithmetic sequence with difference 1
2. **Weekly base increase**: Each Monday is $1 more than the previous Monday
3. **Complete vs partial weeks**: We may have complete weeks plus a partial final week
4. **Arithmetic series formulas**: Can use mathematical formulas instead of simulation

### ⚠️ Constraints Analysis:
- **Small input size**: n ≤ 1000 makes both simulation and mathematical approaches feasible
- **Maximum weeks**: At most 143 weeks (1000 ÷ 7), but typically much fewer
- **Edge cases**:
  - n = 1 (only Monday of week 1)
  - n is multiple of 7 (complete weeks only)
  - n = 1000 (maximum input)

## 📚 Relevant Concepts and Theory

### 🔢 Arithmetic Series Formulas
**Sum of arithmetic sequence**: For sequence `a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+(k-1)`, the sum is:
- `k × a + k × (k-1) / 2`
- Or equivalently: `k × (2a + k - 1) / 2`

### 📊 Weekly Breakdown
- **Complete weeks**: `weeks = n / 7`
- **Remaining days**: `days = n % 7`
- **Week i** (0-indexed): Base amount = `i + 1`, sum = `7 × (i + 1) + 21 = 7i + 28`

### 🎯 Mathematical Optimization
Instead of simulating day by day, we can:
1. **Calculate sum of complete weeks** using arithmetic series formula
2. **Calculate sum of remaining days** in the final partial week
3. **Add both sums** for the total

---

## 🧠 Logical Analysis

### ✅ Why Mathematical Approach Works:
- **Pattern recognition**: The weekly savings follow predictable arithmetic patterns
- **Formula application**: Arithmetic series formulas eliminate the need for loops
- **Efficiency**: O(1) time complexity vs O(n) for simulation

### 🎯 Key Insight: Complete Weeks Sum
For `weeks` complete weeks:
- Week 0 sum: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 28
- Week 1 sum: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35 = 28 + 7
- Week 2 sum: 3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 42 = 28 + 14
- Week i sum: 28 + 7i

Total for `weeks` complete weeks: `weeks × 28 + 7 × (0 + 1 + ... + weeks-1) = weeks × 28 + 7 × weeks × (weeks-1) / 2`

### 🎯 Key Insight: Partial Week Sum
For `days` remaining days in week `weeks`:
- Base amount = `weeks + 1`
- Sum = `(weeks + 1) + (weeks + 2) + ... + (weeks + days)`
- Sum = `days × (weeks + 1) + days × (days - 1) / 2`

## 🎯 Effective Strategy

### 📝 Plan:
1. **Calculate complete weeks**: `weeks = n / 7`
2. **Calculate remaining days**: `days = n % 7`
3. **Compute complete weeks sum**: `weeks × 28 + 7 × weeks × (weeks - 1) / 2`
4. **Compute partial week sum**: `days × (weeks + 1) + days × (days - 1) / 2`
5. **Return total sum**

### 🛠️ Design Decisions:
- **Integer arithmetic**: All operations result in integers due to problem constraints
- **Formula-based**: Avoids loops for better performance and cleaner code
- **Clear variable names**: Makes the mathematical logic readable

## 🧪 Illustrative Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**: `n = 4`
- `weeks = 4 / 7 = 0`, `days = 4 % 7 = 4`
- Complete weeks sum: `0`
- Partial week sum: `4 × (0 + 1) + 4 × 3 / 2 = 4 + 6 = 10`
- **Total = 10** ✅

**Example 2**: `n = 10`
- `weeks = 10 / 7 = 1`, `days = 10 % 7 = 3`
- Complete weeks sum: `1 × 28 + 7 × 1 × 0 / 2 = 28`
- Partial week sum: `3 × (1 + 1) + 3 × 2 / 2 = 6 + 3 = 9`
- **Total = 28 + 9 = 37** ✅

**Example 3**: `n = 20`
- `weeks = 20 / 7 = 2`, `days = 20 % 7 = 6`
- Complete weeks sum: `2 × 28 + 7 × 2 × 1 / 2 = 56 + 7 = 63`
- Partial week sum: `6 × (2 + 1) + 6 × 5 / 2 = 18 + 15 = 33`
- **Total = 63 + 33 = 96** ✅

## ⚡ Optimal Approach

**Mathematical Formula Approach** is optimal because:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - constant time regardless of input size
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - only a few integer variables
- **Handles all cases correctly**: Including edge cases and maximum constraints
- **Efficient and clean**: No loops or conditionals needed

## 📋 Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Calculate** `weeks = n / 7`
2. **Calculate** `days = n % 7`
3. **Compute complete sum**: `weeks * 28 + 7 * weeks * (weeks - 1) / 2`
4. **Compute partial sum**: `days * (weeks + 1) + days * (days - 1) / 2`
5. **Return** `complete_sum + partial_sum`

## 🧪 Test Cases

### ✅ Basic Cases
1. **Example 1**: `n = 4` → `10`
2. **Example 2**: `n = 10` → `37`
3. **Example 3**: `n = 20` → `96`

### ⚠️ Edge Cases
4. **n = 1**: Only Monday week 1 → `1`
5. **n = 7**: Complete week 1 → `28`
6. **n = 14**: Two complete weeks → `28 + 35 = 63`

### 🚀 Boundary Cases
7. **n = 1000**: Maximum input → correct total calculation
