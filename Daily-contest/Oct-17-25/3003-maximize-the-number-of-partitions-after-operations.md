# 3003. Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations

## Problem Description
This problem involves partitioning a string after performing operations.

## Solution Approach
- Uses dynamic programming with memoization
- Tracks current character mask and remaining operations
- Explores different character replacements to maximize partitions

## Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n * 26 * 2^26)
- Space Complexity: O(n * 2^26)

## Implementation
See `3003.java` for the full solution.
