# 🔢 Comprehensive Solution Report: Smallest Number With All Set Bits

---

## 📋 Problem Summary

**Inputs**:  
- `n`: Positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)

**All Set Bits Definition**:  
A number has all set bits if its binary representation consists only of 1s (e.g., 1="1", 3="11", 7="111", 15="1111", etc.)

**Goal**:  
Return the **smallest number x ≥ n** such that x has all set bits in its binary representation

**Output**:  
- Single integer representing the smallest valid number

## 🔍 Key Observations and Constraints

### 🎯 Critical Insights:
1. **All set bits numbers**: These are numbers of the form `2^k - 1` for k ≥ 1
   - k=1: 2¹-1 = 1 = "1"
   - k=2: 2²-1 = 3 = "11"  
   - k=3: 2³-1 = 7 = "111"
   - k=4: 2⁴-1 = 15 = "1111"
   - k=5: 2⁵-1 = 31 = "11111"
   - etc.

2. **Limited candidates**: For n ≤ 1000, we only need to check up to k=10 (2¹⁰-1 = 1023)

3. **Monotonic sequence**: The all-set-bits numbers form a strictly increasing sequence

### ⚠️ Constraints Analysis:
- **Small input range**: n ≤ 1000 means maximum answer is 1023
- **Limited candidates**: Only 10 possible all-set-bits numbers to check
- **Edge cases**:
  - n = 1 → answer = 1
  - n is already all set bits → return n
  - n just above an all-set-bits number → return next one

## 📚 Relevant Concepts and Theory

### 🔢 All Set Bits Numbers Formula
Numbers with all set bits are exactly: `2^k - 1` for k = 1, 2, 3, ...

This is because:
- `2^k` in binary is "1" followed by k zeros
- `2^k - 1` in binary is k ones

### 📊 Precomputation Strategy
Since the constraint is small (n ≤ 1000), we can:
- **Precompute all relevant all-set-bits numbers** up to 1023
- **Find the smallest one ≥ n** using linear search or binary search

### 🎯 Bit Manipulation Alternative
We can also solve this by:
1. Finding the number of bits in n
2. Computing `2^(bits) - 1`
3. If this is ≥ n, return it; otherwise return `2^(bits+1) - 1`

But precomputation is simpler and more readable.

## 🧠 Logical Analysis

### ✅ Why Precomputation Works:
- **Finite candidates**: Only 10 numbers to consider for n ≤ 1000
- **Simple logic**: Linear search through small list
- **Guaranteed coverage**: 2¹⁰-1 = 1023 > 1000, so we cover all cases

### 🎯 Key Insight: Next Power of Two Minus One
The smallest all-set-bits number ≥ n is either:
- `2^k - 1` where k = number of bits in n, if `2^k - 1 ≥ n`
- `2^(k+1) - 1` otherwise

But since the list is small, direct enumeration is clearer.

## 🎯 Effective Strategy

### 📝 Plan:
1. **Generate all-set-bits numbers** up to 1023
2. **Find the smallest number** in this list that is ≥ n
3. **Return** that number

### 🛠️ Design Decisions:
- **Hardcoded list**: Since constraints are small, we can hardcode the candidates
- **Linear search**: With only 10 elements, binary search isn't necessary
- **Clear and simple**: Easy to understand and verify

## 🧪 Illustrative Example Walkthrough

**Example 1**: `n = 5`
- All-set-bits numbers: [1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023]
- Numbers ≥ 5: [7, 15, 31, ...]
- **Smallest = 7** ✅

**Example 2**: `n = 10`
- Numbers ≥ 10: [15, 31, 63, ...]
- **Smallest = 15** ✅

**Example 3**: `n = 3`
- Numbers ≥ 3: [3, 7, 15, ...]
- **Smallest = 3** ✅

## ⚡ Optimal Approach

**Precomputed List with Linear Search** is optimal because:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - constant time with small fixed list
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - fixed size list
- **Simple implementation**: No complex bit manipulation needed
- **Handles all cases correctly**: Including edge cases

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Algorithm

1. **Create list** of all-set-bits numbers: [1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023]
2. **Iterate through list**:
   - Find first number ≥ n
3. **Return** that number

---

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

### ⏱️ Time Complexity: **O(1)**
- **Fixed list size**: 10 elements maximum
- **Linear search**: O(10) = O(1)

### 💾 Space Complexity: **O(1)**
- **Fixed array**: 10 integers
- **Constant space**: Independent of input size

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

### ✅ Basic Cases
1. **Example 1**: `n = 5` → `7`
2. **Example 2**: `n = 10` → `15`
3. **Example 3**: `n = 3` → `3`

### ⚠️ Edge Cases
4. **n = 1**: Already all set bits → `1`
5. **n = 1023**: Maximum all-set-bits number → `1023`
6. **n = 1024**: Would need next number, but constraint ensures n ≤ 1000

### 🚀 Boundary Cases
7. **n = 1000**: Should return `1023`
8. **n = 512**: Should return `1023` (since 511 < 512)
