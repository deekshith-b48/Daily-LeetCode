### Problem: **778. Swim in Rising Water**

---

### 🔍 Step 1: **Understand the Question — Literally**

> **What is being asked?**  
> You start at the top-left `(0,0)` of an `n x n` grid.  
> Each cell has an **elevation** (a number).  
> At **time `t`**, water level = `t`.  
> You can **swim through any cell** whose elevation ≤ `t`.  
> You can move **up/down/left/right** (4 directions).  
> **Goal**: Find the **earliest time `t`** when you can reach `(n-1, n-1)`.

> 💡 **Key phrase**:  
> _“You can swim from A to B if **both** elevations ≤ t.”_  
> → So every cell on your path must have elevation ≤ t.

---

### 🔍 Step 2: **Restate in Your Own Words**

> “I need to find the smallest water level `t` such that there’s a path from start to end where **no step goes above elevation `t`**.”

This is **not** about total time or steps — it’s about the **highest elevation** you must cross.

> 🎯 **Reframe the problem**:  
> **Find the path from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) that minimizes the maximum elevation along the path.**

That’s a classic **“minimax path”** problem!

---

### 🔍 Step 3: **Analyze Examples**

#### Example 1: `[[0,2],[1,3]]`

- Path options:
  - (0,0) → (0,1) → (1,1): max elevation = max(0,2,3) = **3**
  - (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1): max = max(0,1,3) = **3**
- Can’t do it at t=2 because (1,1)=3 > 2.
- ✅ So answer = **3**

#### Example 2: Spiral grid → answer = **16**

- The path is forced to go through a “bottleneck” at elevation 16.
- Even if other cells are lower, you **must** cross 16 to connect start and end.

> ✅ Insight: **The answer is the smallest `t` such that start and end are connected using only cells ≤ `t`.**

---

### 🔍 Step 4: **Identify the Right Strategy**

Ask yourself:

| Question | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Is the answer monotonic? | ✅ Yes! If you can swim at time `t`, you can at `t+1`, `t+2`, etc. |
| Can I check “is it possible at time `t`?” quickly? | ✅ Yes! Use BFS/DFS to see if path exists using only cells ≤ `t`. |
| What’s the range of possible answers? | From `grid[0][0]` to `max(grid)` |

👉 This screams: **Binary Search on Answer + BFS**

---

### 🔍 Step 5: **Design the Algorithm**

#### Plan:
1. **Binary search** over possible `t` values.
2. For each `t`, run **BFS** to check connectivity.
3. Find the **smallest `t`** where BFS succeeds.

#### Why it works:
- Monotonicity → binary search is valid.
- BFS checks connectivity in `O(n²)` → fast for `n ≤ 50`.

### 🔍 Step 6: **Implement the Solution**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int swimInWater(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int left = grid[0][0];
        int right = 0;
        
        // Find max elevation
        for (int[] row : grid) {
            for (int val : row) {
                right = Math.max(right, val);
            }
        }
        
        // Binary search on time t
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canReach(grid, mid)) {
                right = mid;      // Try smaller t
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;   // Need larger t
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    private boolean canReach(int[][] grid, int t) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (grid[0][0] > t) return false;
        
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n];
        Queue<int[]> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.offer(new int[]{0, 0});
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        int[][] dirs = {{-1,0}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {0,1}};
        
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = q.poll();
            int r = cell[0], c = cell[1];
            
            if (r == n - 1 && c == n - 1) return true;
            
            for (int[] d : dirs) {
                int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];
                if (nr >= 0 && nr < n && nc >= 0 && nc < n 
                    && !visited[nr][nc] && grid[nr][nc] <= t) {
                    visited[nr][nc] = true;
                    q.offer(new int[]{nr, nc});
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 🔍 Step 7: **Verify with Examples**

| Input | Output | How? |
|------|--------|------|
| `[[0,2],[1,3]]` | `3` | BFS succeeds at t=3 |
| Spiral grid | `16` | Path requires crossing 16 |
| `[[0]]` | `0` | Already at destination |

✅ All pass.

---

### 🔍 Step 8: **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time**: `O(n² log(maxElevation))`  
  - Binary search: `log(max)` ≈ 12–15 iterations (since max ≤ 2500)
  - Each BFS: `O(n²)` = 2500 operations
  - Total: ~30,000 operations → very fast

- **Space**: `O(n²)` for `visited` array and queue

---

### 🔍 Step 9: **Alternative Approaches (Advanced)**

You could also solve this with:

#### ✅ **Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Minimax Version)**
- Priority queue stores `(maxElevationSoFar, row, col)`
- Always expand the path with smallest max elevation
- Stop when you reach `(n-1, n-1)`

This is **more efficient** in theory (`O(n² log n)`), but **binary search + BFS** is easier to understand and implement.

### 🔍 Step 10: **How to Apply This Knowledge**

When you see a problem like this, ask:

1. **Is the answer monotonic?**  
   → If “yes”, consider **binary search on answer**.

2. **Can I verify a candidate answer quickly?**  
   → If “yes”, design a **checker function** (like `canReach`).

3. **What’s the range of answers?**  
   → Set `left` and `right` bounds.

4. **What algorithm checks feasibility?**  
   → BFS/DFS for connectivity, DP for optimization, etc.

This pattern works for many problems:
- “Minimum time to reach…”
- “Smallest capacity to ship…”
- “Least max value on path…”
